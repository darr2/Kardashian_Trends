# Kardashian_Trends
This project explores the 
[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2007-01-01%202019-03-21&q=%2Fm%2F0261x8t,%2Fm%2F043p2f2,%2Fm%2F043ttm7,%2Fm%2F05_5_yx,%2Fm%2F05_5_yh) 
of the Kardashian/Jenner sisters from January 1, 2007 until March 21, 2019. Our goal is to see who is the most famous among
the Kardashian/Jenner sister.

We are interested in the trends of:
<ul>
  <li>Kim Kardashian</li>
  <li>Khloe Kardashian</li>
  <li>Kourtney Kardashian</li>
  <li>Kendall Jenner</li>
  <li>Kylie Jenner</li>
</ul>

We start off by cleaning the data set so that we can set up plots to clearly visualize their trends.
For anyone who is keeping up with the Kardashians (pun intended), the results you will find are
far from surprising.
